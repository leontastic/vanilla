# Vanilla

**Vanilla** is a template for traditional website builds, providing a conventional file organization system. It includes essential libraries and base files for front-end development. Similar to [HTML5 Reset](https://github.com/murtaugh/HTML5-Reset).

## Libraries and Base Files

### jQuery
Vanilla uses **jQuery 2.1.0** (http://jquery.com/download/). The line breaks in the original file have been removed.

### reset.css
A custom **reset.css** optimized for projects with conventional requirements.
